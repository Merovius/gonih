# What is this?

A bag-grab dumping ground for small Go packages which are not part of any
particular project, but which I need occasionally and want to have at hand
then.

The name is a nod to the fact that for most of them, the only thing
distinguishing them from the existing alternatives is that those where
[not invented here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here). That is,
they where not written by me and I have bigger or smaller problems with their
APIs or implementation.

That being said, if I have to succumb to NIH syndrome anyway, I might as well
publish the result and re-use it in multiple projects.
